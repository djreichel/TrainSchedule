# TrainSchedule

Sample code by D.J. Reichel

Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Instructions: Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:

When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
Train Name
Destination 
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes
Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

Summary

I was able to create the form for user input. I achieved the dynamically created row from user input. I still need more work on the moment API component to convert and tally schedule times.
